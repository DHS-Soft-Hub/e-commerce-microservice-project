## âœ… What Works Correctly
1. Saga Definition: The OrderCreateSaga correctly defines all the states and transitions.
2. Domain Events: Order creation properly raises domain events that trigger the saga.
3. Configuration: The saga is properly configured in the DI container.
4. Order Tracking UI: Shows the correct workflow steps.

  [*] --> ReservingInventory: OrderCreated\n/ Send ReserveInventoryCommand

  state "Reserving Inventory" as ReservingInventory
  state "Processing Payment" as ProcessingPayment
  state "Creating Shipment" as CreatingShipment
  state Shipped
  state Cancelled
  state Completed

  ReservingInventory --> ProcessingPayment: InventoryReserved\n/ Send ProcessPaymentCommand
  ReservingInventory --> Cancelled: InventoryReservationFailed\n/ Publish OrderStatusChanged(Cancelled)\nFinalize

  ProcessingPayment --> CreatingShipment: PaymentProcessed\n/ Send CreateShipmentCommand
  ProcessingPayment --> Cancelled: PaymentFailed\n/ Send ReleaseInventoryCommand\nPublish OrderStatusChanged(Cancelled)\nFinalize

  CreatingShipment --> Shipped: ShipmentCreated\n/ Publish OrderStatusChanged(Shipped)
  CreatingShipment --> Cancelled: ShipmentFailed\n/ Send RefundPaymentCommand\nSend ReleaseInventoryCommand\nPublish OrderStatusChanged(Cancelled)\nFinalize

  Shipped --> Completed: OrderDelivered\n/ Publish OrderStatusChanged(Completed)\nFinalize

  Cancelled --> [*]
  Completed --> [*]

## ðŸ”§ Required Fixes to Make Frontend Follow Saga Logic
The changes I made to the Frontend are just the first step. To fully implement the saga pattern, you need:

1. Create Inventory Service that handles:

- ReserveInventoryCommand â†’ publishes InventoryReservedIntegrationEvent or InventoryReservationFailedIntegrationEvent
- ReleaseInventoryCommand â†’ publishes InventoryReleasedIntegrationEvent

2. Create Shipping Service that handles:

- CreateShipmentCommand â†’ publishes ShipmentCreatedIntegrationEvent or ShipmentFailedIntegrationEvent
- Delivery tracking â†’ publishes OrderDeliveredIntegrationEvent

3. Update Payment Service to handle:

- ProcessPaymentCommand â†’ publishes PaymentProcessedIntegrationEvent or PaymentFailedIntegrationEvent
- RefundPaymentCommand â†’ publishes PaymentRefundedIntegrationEvent or PaymentRefundFailedIntegrationEvent
The Frontend changes I made ensure it only creates orders and lets the saga handle the rest.
